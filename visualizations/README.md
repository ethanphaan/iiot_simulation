# Visualizations

This folder contains sensor data visualization outputs from the IIoT simulation.

## Files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `mqtt_visualization.png` | Real-time temperature & humidity plot from MQTT simulation |
| `coap_visualization.png` | Real-time temperature & humidity plot from CoAP simulation |
| `opcua_visualization.png` | Real-time temperature & humidity plot from OPC UA simulation |
| `visualization_demo.mp4` | Screen recording of real-time data visualization in action |

## How to Generate

Run the following from the project root to generate all PNG visualizations:

```bash
python generate_visualizations.py
```

This will create all three PNG files in this folder using simulated sensor data.

## Notes
- PNG files are generated by `generate_visualizations.py` using NumPy and Matplotlib
- The `visualization_demo.mp4` is a screen recording captured while running `data_visualization.py` live with the MQTT broker active
- All charts display 60 seconds of temperature and humidity sensor readings
